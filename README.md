# Wedge Investigation

There are a couple of files here: 

* `Wedge Investigation.ipynb`: In this code we'll explore a Wedge file. The
notebook will walk you through it. There are some
sections you can run before class if you'd like, but most of it is for class itself.

* `File Testing.ipynb`: This code will help you do a bunch of the file
manipulation work you'll need to do for the Wedge Project. We won't get to
all of this in the first class where we talk about it, but you should 
consider working your way through this whole notebook before starting
work on the Wedge project in earnest.
