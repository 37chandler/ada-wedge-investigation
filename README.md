# Wedge Investigation

There are a couple of files here: 

* `Wedge Investigation.ipynb`: In this code we'll explore a Wedge file. The
notebook will walk you through it. There are some
sections you can run before class if you'd like, but most of it is for class itself.

* `File Testing.ipynb`: This code will help you do a bunch of the file
manipulation work you'll need to do for the Wedge Project. There are a series
of questions in this file for you to answer and some places for you to fill 
in code that performs specific tasks.
